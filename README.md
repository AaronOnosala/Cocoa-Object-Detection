# Cocoa-Object-Detection
## Background
The Cocoa Object Detection project aimed to create a robust model for identifying cocoa fruit at various stages 

1. __Mature_Unripe__ - Images with mature but not yet ripe cocoa pods
2. __Immature__ - Images with Cocoa pods that are still growing.
3. __Ripped__ - Images with ripe mature cocoa pods.
4. __Spoilt__ - Images with Spoilt cocoa pods.
![cocoa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f112077-0d8a-4637-8ab9-400ec9bcc4c0)
from images. The original dataset was in PASCAL VOC XML format, the dataset contains objects in cocoa trees under 4 classes Spoilt, Immature, Mature_Unripe and Ripped. It has been split into 3 subsets.

  * Train with 4550 images.
  * Validation with 1262 images.
  * Test with 318 images.
The dataset can be downloaded as a single zip file of ~370MB from [here.](https://storage.googleapis.com/air-lab-hackathon/Cocoa/cocoa_new.zip)
